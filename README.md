## Project Overview
Predictive Health Analytics is an innovative application designed to leverage machine learning models to predict the risk of diabetes in patients based on their medical history, lifestyle factors, and biometric measurements. The tool aims to facilitate early detection of diabetes, enabling timely medical intervention and potentially reducing the burden of the disease on patients and healthcare systems.

## Problem Statement
Diabetes is a chronic condition that can lead to severe health complications if not diagnosed and managed early. The primary problem this project addresses is the early detection of diabetes in patients. By predicting the risk of diabetes, healthcare providers can identify high-risk individuals and take proactive measures to manage the disease before it progresses.

## Goals
- **Early Detection:** Identify patients at high risk of developing diabetes for timely intervention.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Use machine learning models to analyze patient data and predict diabetes risk.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Develop an intuitive interface for healthcare providers to input data and view predictions.
- **Seamless Integration:** Ensure smooth data flow between frontend and backend systems.

## Scope
- **Included:** 
  - Predictive modeling for diabetes risk based on patient data.
  - Basic encryption and authentication for data security.
  - User interface for data input and result visualization.
- **Not Included:**
  - Real-time medical diagnosis.
  - Advanced security measures for handling sensitive medical data.
  - Integration with existing electronic health records (EHR) systems.
  - Comprehensive diabetes management features (e.g., treatment planning, medication tracking).

## Technologies
- **Libraries and Frameworks:**
  - TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn for machine learning.
  - Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation and numerical computing.
- **Programming Languages:**
  - Python for data science and machine learning tasks.
  - JavaScript for frontend development.
- **Platforms and Tools:**
  - Django for backend web framework.
  - React for frontend development.
  - Docker for containerization and deployment.
  - Git for version control.
  - Trello for project management.
